# Face-Recognition

- face_detection.ipynb uses haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml to detect face.
- data_collection.ipynb file is used to collect facial data of several user to create a self-curated dataset.
- face_recognition.ipynb file detects a face use Haar Cacade and then uses KNN(K - Nearest Neighbours) Algorithm to match the face from the available dataset.

This project has several real life applications like:
- Automated Attendance System
- Properly designed systems can installed in airports, multiplexes, and other public places for security purposes
- Smart phones uses Face Recognition Lock
